# go-helloworld
I've created this project for my self-learning on a Udemy Course [Go: The Complete Developer's Guide (Golang)] as part of revision

**Instructor:**

All of the diagrams in this course can be downloaded and marked up by you!

Here's how:
Go to https://github.com/StephenGrider/GoCasts/tree/master/diagrams

Open the folder containing the set of diagrams you want to edit

Click on the ‘.xml’ file

Click the ‘raw’ button

Copy the URL

Go to https://www.draw.io/

On the ‘Save Diagrams To…’ window click ‘Decide later’ at the bottom

Click ‘File’ -> ‘Import From’ -> ‘URL’

Paste the link to the XML file

Tada!
